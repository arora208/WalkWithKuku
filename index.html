              On my third visit to India I went with some friends & family to
              Jodhpur to experience the fantatsic He to Nitin, he not only took
              us to all the great spots in the city to enjoy the Festival with
              the locals where we got stuck in to the festivities along with
              Nitin but the cherry on the cake for us was that he took us to the
              festivities at his friends house where instead of being tourists
              we felt a real part of the celebrations and joined in with all the
              fun.

              We met kuku in Jodhpur which was the final city we visited on our
              india trip.He was not only knowlegable on the history of India and
              Jodhpur but also very passionate. As we love listening to stories,
              kuku was perfect as he explained everything to make us fall in
              love with india even more. Also showed us some hidden gems, and
              shared some delicious street food! kuku was also super helpful and
              went beyond his job description when we had a slight emergency and
              needed a doctor's consultation. If we were to make another trip to
              jodhpur again, we will definitely get kuku to accompany us again.

              friendly and careful. For me it was a big highlight during my stay
              in Jodhpur. Being in the desert, seeing the life of people in the
              village was a pleasant change to the life in the big cities. I
              felt very grateful and peaceful after this ride on the camel

              The best off road and leopard safari we have ever done. Drive ,
              Sighting and our hostkuku were absolutely outstanding. This was a
              last minute decision and we booked from airport as we were waiting
              for taxi.booking was done on the go. The safari drive over hills
              were thrilling and once in a lifetime experience. kuku is seasoned
              naturalist and host provided us many details of the terrain and
              also fauna. Icing on the cake was sighting of a majestic male
              leopard. Overall an absolutely great experience...
